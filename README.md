# LeagueLook

League Look is a simple application that allows users to search any player to pull up some information about the game the player is in. This information includes the game mode, game time, and each player in the game, as well as their respective ranks on ladder.

The idea is to give players a dedicated mobile application that allows them to quickly find information of a player and the game the player is playing. I used the API methods of: Summoner-V3, Spectator-V3, and League-V3.
